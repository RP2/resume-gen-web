## üé® AI Integration & Privacy

Our AI integration prioritizes your privacy and security:

### üîê **Maximum Security Architecture**

- **React State Storage**: API key stored only in memory (React state) - most secure option
- **No Persistent Storage**: Unlike localStorage or cookies, keys never touch disk storage
- **Session-Only Memory**: Keys exist only while the browser tab is open, cleared on close
- **XSS Protection**: Memory-only storage prevents cross-site scripting access to keys
- **No Server Transmission**: We never store, log, or transmit your API key to our servers
- **Direct Browser-to-OpenAI**: All AI requests go directly from your browser to OpenAI
- **Zero Data Retention**: Your resume data and AI interactions stay completely private

**Why React State vs. localStorage/cookies?**

- ‚úÖ **React State**: Stored in memory only, cleared on tab close, immune to XSS attacks on persistent storage
- ‚ùå **localStorage**: Persists on disk, accessible by any script, potential XSS vulnerability
- ‚ùå **Cookies**: Sent with every request, potential security risks, persistent storage
